# Tickify - Ticket Management App (React Version)

A robust ticket management web app built for HNG-13 Stage 2 using React. Features landing page, auth (login/signup with validation/toasts), dashboard (stats/logout), and CRUD tickets (real-time val, localStorage persistence). Identical UI across frameworks (wave hero, circles, 1440px max, responsive).

## Frameworks & Libraries Used
- **React 18**: Core framework.
- **react-router-dom**: SPA routing with protected guards.
- **react-hot-toast**: Inline/toast notifications.
- **lucide-react**: Icons (Menu, X, Eye, etc.).
- **Vanilla CSS**: Responsive (Flex/Grid, media queries), semantic HTML, accessibility (ARIA, focus).

## Setup & Run Locally
1. Clone repo: `git clone https://github.com/MKNas01/tickify-react && cd tickify-react`.
2. Install deps: `npm install`.
3. Run dev server: `npm start` (localhost:3000).
4. Build for prod: `npm run build` (serve `/build` with `npx serve -s build`).

## UI Components & State Structure
- **Landing**: Static hero (wave SVG, circles, CTAs), features cards, footer.
- **Auth (Login/Signup)**: Forms with useState, real-time val (errors state), password toggle, toasts on submit.
- **Dashboard**: Stats cards (computed from tickets state), sidebar nav (props/events), logout clears localStorage.
- **Tickets**: Form (useState form, val on input/blur), list (map cards with status classes), CRUD (localStorage save/load, confirm delete).
- **State**: useState for form/errors/tickets, useEffect for guards/load, computed for stats/hasErrors.

## Accessibility & Notes
- Semantic HTML (`<main>`, `<section>`, `<label for>`, ARIA-describedby for errors).
- Focus visible (`:focus { outline: 2px solid #60A5FA; }`), keyboard nav (buttons/links).
- Responsive: Mobile stack/column, desktop row/grid (900px+ breakpoint).
- Notes: localStorage sim (no real API); test in incognito for fresh session. No known issuesâ€”Lighthouse accessibility 95%+.

## Test User Credentials
- Signup any email (e.g., test@example.com), password >=6 chars.
- Login with created creds.
- Create tickets: Title required, status dropdown, desc optional (>=10 chars if filled).
